# ScreenShield: Computer Monitor Tracking and Blurring for Video

**ScreenShield** is a real-time video processing pipeline that detects, segments, tracks, and inpaints computer monitor screens in video. It's optimized for low-latency use cases like livestreams, video conferencing, or on-device video capture where sensitive screen content must be obscured dynamically.

## 🧠 Pipeline Overview

The ScreenShield pipeline consists of four key stages:

1. **Detection**  
   A fine-tuned YOLOv11 model is run on each input frame to detect computer monitors using bounding boxes. Once a monitor is detected, the system proceeds to segmentation.

2. **Segmentation**  
   The frame is passed to a YOLOv11-based segmentation model to generate a pixel-level mask of each screen.

3. **Tracking**  
   Cutie (a video object segmentation model) tracks the segmented masks across subsequent frames to avoid redundant segmentation. If the number of screen instances changes, the system re-runs segmentation.

4. **Inpainting**  
   Each mask region is blurred using a Gaussian blur. Optionally, users can overlay a custom logo or a white border on each screen region.
